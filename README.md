# Information Retrieval, Extraction and Integration
## MUCD at UPM

Four assignments with different topics were carried out:
 <ol>
  <li><b>Profile Based Retrieval</b>. Two known datasets (OHSUMED and Reuters) related to the NLP field were preprocessed with nltk and subsequently classified through kNN and Neural Networks. </li>
  <li><b>Non-textual Data Extraction</b>. Two similarity metrics were created to find affinity between artworks, regarding color and texture. CBIR methods were used.</li>
  <li><b>Search engines</b>. An algorithm based on logistic regression was implemented to find the relevance of each document in a dataset given a certain query.</li>
  <li><b>Data Integration, Bias and Fairness</b>. Several datasets related to mental health and economy are theoretically analyzed in terms of bias, integration and fairness.</li>
</ol>
